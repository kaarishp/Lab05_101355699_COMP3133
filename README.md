# TypeScript Overview

TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript, adding optional static typing and other features on top of JavaScript. TypeScript code transcompiles to plain JavaScript, compatible with any JavaScript runtime environment (e.g., web browsers or Node.js).

## Key Features

1. **Static Typing**: TypeScript enables developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values, catching type-related errors during development and enhancing code documentation and editor support.

2. **ECMAScript Compatibility**: Being a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript accepts any valid JavaScript code, facilitating its gradual adoption into existing projects.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming Features**: TypeScript supports features like classes, interfaces, inheritance, and access modifiers, enhancing the capabilities of traditional JavaScript.

4. **Type Inference**: TypeScript can infer types based on context, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.

5. **Tooling Support**: TypeScript enjoys strong support in modern code editors and IDEs, offering features such as code completion, refactoring tools, and error checking.

6. **Modern Language Features**: TypeScript incorporates many features from the latest versions of JavaScript (ECMAScript), including async/await, destructuring, arrow functions, and more.

## Purpose

TypeScript aims to improve the development experience of large-scale JavaScript applications by providing better tooling, error detection, and maintainability through the use of static types and modern language features.

## Getting Started

To start using TypeScript in your project, you'll need to install it via npm:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
